# üî• CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION FIXES - DEPLOYED!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Login Persistence Fixed
Your login will now be remembered for **7 days** instead of just 24 hours. The app will automatically restore your session when you return to the website.

**Technical fixes:**
- Session cookies now persist for 7 days
- Fixed cookie settings for cross-site requests on Vercel
- Added triple-layer authentication storage (session, memory, Redis)
- Sessions are now properly saved even before user interaction

### 2. ‚úÖ Authentication Status Display Fixed
The app will now correctly show you're logged in after connecting Google Calendar.

**Technical fixes:**
- Immediate UI update after successful OAuth callback
- Better session restoration from multiple sources
- Fixed race conditions in auth status checking
- Added visual confirmation of authentication state

### 3. ‚úÖ Google Calendar Integration Fixed
Reservations will now **ACTUALLY CREATE EVENTS** on your Google Calendar!

**Technical fixes:**
- Enhanced token discovery across all storage layers
- Better handling of expired tokens with auto-refresh
- Improved error logging to diagnose calendar issues
- Fixed credential passing to Google Calendar API

## üö® IMPORTANT: What You Need to Do

### 1. Clear Your Browser Data (One Time)
Since we changed how sessions work, you need to clear old session data:

**For Chrome/Edge:**
1. Press `Cmd+Shift+Delete` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (Windows)
2. Select "Cookies and other site data" 
3. Choose time range: "Last 7 days"
4. Click "Clear data"

### 2. Re-authenticate with Google
1. Go to your app: https://room5.vercel.app
2. Click "Connect Google Calendar" button
3. Sign in with Google
4. Grant all requested permissions (especially Calendar access)
5. You should see "‚úÖ Google Calendar connected successfully!"

### 3. Test Calendar Integration
1. Create a test reservation
2. Check your Google Calendar - the event should appear immediately
3. The reservation card should show a green "üìÖ" icon indicating calendar sync

## üîç How to Verify Everything Works

### Check Authentication Persistence:
1. After logging in, close your browser completely
2. Open the app again - you should still be logged in
3. The button should show your name/email instead of "Connect Google Calendar"

### Check Calendar Events:
1. Create a reservation
2. Open Google Calendar (calendar.google.com)
3. You should see "Film Room - [Your Name]" event
4. The event should have:
   - Correct date and time
   - Email invitation sent to the reservation email
   - 30-minute email reminder
   - 10-minute popup reminder

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Still not staying logged in"
- Make sure cookies are enabled for the site
- Try using Chrome or Edge (best compatibility)
- Check if you're using incognito mode (sessions won't persist)

### "Calendar events not appearing"
1. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Make sure you granted Calendar permissions during login
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting Google Calendar
4. Verify your Google account has Calendar enabled

### "Getting 'WRONGPASS' errors"
You need to set up Upstash Redis in Vercel:
1. Go to [Upstash](https://upstash.com/)
2. Create a free Redis database
3. Add credentials to Vercel environment variables:
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
   - `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`
4. Redeploy your app

## üìù What's Different Now?

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues after following these steps:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Look at Vercel Functions logs for server-side errors
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly in Vercel

The authentication system is now much more robust and should handle edge cases better!
